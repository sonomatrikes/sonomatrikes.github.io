  rental_rate_week: $600
  description: >
    The Rotovelo is the first velomobile to ever be constructed from roto-molded
    HDPE (think kayak plastic).  Underneath is a proven frame made from 4130
    aircraft spec. chromoly that is similar to their Gizmo touring trike in
    geometry and handling, with a 27spd drivetrain and mechanical disc brakes.
    Velomobiles offer the rider protection from their environment, more visibility
    to other drivers, and can maintain a higher average speed due to clean
    aerodynamics.  Until now the shells were hand-laid composite materials, and
    thus a little delicate for daily use, but that is no longer a concern with the
    Rotovelo.  There is an onboard lighting system, mirror, a removable top hatch,
    built-in luggage space, and optional full coverage top if needed to make this
    a bike you can ride year round.

    lightweight separable steel frame, and incredibly comfortable carbon
    hardshell seat with a built-in head rest. The Gizmo can serve as a sporty
    daily commuter, or be packed up and taken to your favorite cycling
    destination for an extended touring expedition.
