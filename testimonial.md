title: Sonoma Trikes - Upgrades & Accessories
---

A year, or possibly two, ago my husband decided that he wanted to start riding his bike again (a monstrous green recumbent with scary gears, twitchy handlebars, and a humongous yellow bag). I was totally cool with this, he could hook the burley up to his bike and take the kids, I could enjoy a lovely child-and-husband free morning, and then he dropped the “I want to ride with you” bombshell. 

Do what? 

Ride together, as a family. 

For a bit of context, the last time I’d regularly ridden a bike was in the late 1990s, to and from high school. It was sea-foam green, with no gears and no handbrakes. I lived in a nice, flat part of Texas, no hills, just the very, very slight incline of my parent’s driveway. When I moved out, I left my bike in my parent’s garage, my mom later sold it to a family friend. 

In mid-2000-something, my husband decided I “needed a bike” so we went to the local bike store and bought a bike. It was pastel blue, had some gears (which terrified me), hand breaks (which terrified me more), and what was possibly the worlds most uncomfortable seat (he insists it wasn’t that bad). I became pregnant shortly after acquiring the bike, and it sat in the garage for four years — until my husband decided we should go for a “family bike ride.” <img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9768789563_b6c34ec782_z_d.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right img-inline">

There were a few problems with the idea of a “bike ride” — for starters, we live at the top of a hill, our street connects to highway 12, we have two children who need to come along and they’re not exactly light. 

Fine, we can go for a “family” bike ride, but you’re hauling the kids.

So we hooked the burley up to the back of my husband’s bike, loaded in the kids (complete with helmets), and we went for a “family” bike ride. We made it down the hill in front of the house (a 16% grade) and I freaked out. I swore I was never going to ride down that hill again. You want me to LET GO OF THE HANDLEBARS TO SIGNAL THAT I’M TURNING? NO WAY! I must CLING TO THEM FOR DEAR LIFE. I had a bad accident when I was younger (head first over the handlebars going down a hill) and I haven’t liked hills, or handbrakes since.

That was a fun ride. 

The dear husband decided to try again. Eventually we managed to make it about 4 miles (maybe), because we loaded the bikes into the car and drove to the flat bike path — I was not going to try the hill outside the house again!

To make the “family bike ride work” we worked out an agreement: the husband would haul 80+ pounds of children in the trailer, and I would not fall over, and or get myself seriously injured. I complained bitterly, the seat was uncomfortable, my back hurt, my neck hurt, my shoulders hurt, my wrists hurt, the sun was in my face. I hoped that this complaining would put an end to the rides. 

No such luck. 

We went to REI, bought silly padded pants that chafed, a hat, adjusted my helmet. He was determined to make “family” bike rides a reality. I was determined to get my mornings to myself. My complaining only bolstered his determination, and he had the BRILLIANT idea that I should “try” his recumbent bike.

So the dear husband called the recumbent bike guru he’d bought the green monster from and got pointers on how to teach me how to ride it. Apparently I was supposed to “just sit on it and coast down the hill” — because somehow I’d manage to magically stay upright, steer properly and not hit the row of parked cars to my right. You know I have a totally rational terror of hills, right? And handbrakes? And losing my balance? And hitting things? 

I got maybe five yards (I’m being generous to myself, I feel I deserve a fair bit of credit for even trying the green contraption). The only thing the green thing had going for it was the seat was more comfortable (as long as my feet were firmly planted on the ground). The balancing/steering thing wasn’t really working out for me. Coasting down a hill towards parked cars wasn’t really working either. Throughly shaken, I went and hid in the house.

Armed with the begrudging admission the seat was more comfortable, and the power of the internet, the dear husband did a bit of looking around and found recumbent trikes. The recumbent position would solve the back, neck, shoulder, and wrist discomfort. 

At one point there was a local recumbent trike dealer in town. After several visits and many questions, the dear husband convinced me to test ride a recumbent trike: first around the parking lot, and then on a longer ride along the bike path (about 4 miles). 

I liked the stability of the trike, not worrying about falling off was huge. I wasn’t a huge fan of the hand brakes or gears, but I’d never really ridden a bike with those other than the pastel blue one that I was convinced was trying to throw me on every hill I went down. The only thing I disliked was the seat, I felt like I was going to slide off the front, in turns I felt like I was going to slide off sideways. <img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/12824728085_025ccb4f31_z_d.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right img-inline">

The dear husband decided he was on the right track with the recumbent trike idea so he went back to the internet and did a bunch of looking around. Eventually he found a relatively local (and very child-friendly) dealer (Nanda) who was willing to let us test out trikes with small children in tow (this was no easy feat). The dear husband had a few ideas as to what he thought I’d want, so they pulled a few trikes for me to try. 

I’m going to state now that I’m not the bike geek, my husband is. Nanda was very sweet and did his best to explain the features and differences — I may have glazed over a bit, and I know I asked some slightly stupid (not remotely bike-savvy) questions, Nanda answered them all in terms I could understand. I tried maybe half a dozen trikes of various configurations until I found one that I liked. We decided to rent two (one for me, and one for my husband) for a week to try out. 

With in a few days of picking up the rentals we went on a thirty-mile bike ride. YES, 30 MILES. I struggled a bit on the hills and with the gearing — keep in mind up until then I’d only done maybe four miles on the flat and I’d done my best to avoid dealing with changing gears. The husband and Nanda helped with the gearing and I occasionally got an extra push on the hills which was hugely helpful. The most frustrating part of the ride (aside from the gear-changing issues) was occasionally my feet slipped off the pedals. <img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5547/9991515713_9e71b1dfe3_z_d.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right img-inline">

The way my husband tells the story is he knew the trike was right for me because the “next day” after the 30 mile ride I suggested (of my own volition) that we should go for another ride, and leave from our house — down the hill of doom, around the park, with some light off-roading. We road the rental trikes almost every day, and at the end of our rental period it was an easy sale. 

My husband’s dream of family bike rides has come true, and my desire for the occasional morning to myself has also come to pass. Most weekends we go for a family ride — down the hill, along the bike path, sometimes stopping for coffee and pastries (I am motivated by a good pastry), and some weekends he takes one or both of the kids for a ride on his own. 

Nanda’s started having a regular end-of-month 30-mile bike ride, and we regularly participate. I’ve gotten much better at changing gears, going up and down hills, and using the handbrakes. I got clip-in shoes so my feet stay on the pedals. I’m no longer terrified of the hill in front of the house. I sometimes load a kid into the burly and take them to the park (all on my own). The biggest downside is that now the dear husband expects me to haul the kids sometimes — they get heavy, and they like to shout “go faster!” when I crawl up the hills in the lowest gear possible. 

The other problem I have is every now and then someone who is bike-geekier than I am asks me about my trike. I know it’s blue. I know there’s not enough space on the fenders for the Dr. Who decals I want, and I haven’t been able to find any sparkly unicorn decals in an appropriate size either. I know I’m not going to fall over, or off, and I know the ride is very comfortable. I know it has full suspension — this is very important, the roads out here have potholes that would fit a smart car. I think it has disk brakes? I’m not sure, I know it stops well, even when hauling 100+ lbs of children, stuff and trailer. I finally learned how to put the chain back on when it comes derailed (I’m very proud of myself for that, even if my hand did get all greasy). Most importantly, I know I enjoy riding it much more than I’ve enjoyed riding any other bike and that’s what matters most.
